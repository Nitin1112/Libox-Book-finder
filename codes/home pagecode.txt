            <p id="aboutbook">A book is a medium for recording information in the form of writing or images, typically composed of many
                pages (made of papyrus, parchment, vellum, or paper) bound together and protected by a cover. It can
                also be a handwritten or printed work of fiction or nonfiction, usually on sheets of paper fastened or
                bound together within covers. The technical term for this physical arrangement is codex (plural,
                codices). In the history of hand-held physical supports for extended written compositions or records,
                the codex replaces its predecessor, the scroll. A single sheet in a codex is a leaf and each side of a
                leaf is a page.</p>
